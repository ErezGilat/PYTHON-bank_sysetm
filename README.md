# PYTHON-bank_sysetm
Bank system program using python OOP, Regex, Pickle, Pandas and many other nice python functions.
The following program is a user friendly bank system. the Target of my project was to use some OOP elemnts in python and to validate the information before it gets into the system.

My recommendation is to make a validation for the phyisical addrees using google API or any other provider, I have deleted my private API application but it's pretty easy to do.

The program is a one file python script that contains every thing you need to know.

FYI, The bank already contains an account number 43920 with the password dani123 and email dani@gmail.com The .csv file 43920.csv is the data of transaction made by account with the number 43920.
You can choose to create a new bank when starting the program or start with the bank I already created.

Thank you, Erez Gilat.
